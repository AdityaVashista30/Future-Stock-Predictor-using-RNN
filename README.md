# Future-Stock-Predictor-using-RNN
This is used to predict and visualize future stock price predictions using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
A RNN regressor is created in this model where the model predicts the new pstock price using following informations:
       
        i. Opening Price
        ii. Lowest Price of that day
        iii. Highest Price of that day
