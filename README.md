# Future-Stock-Predictor-using-RNN
This is used to predict and visualize future stock price predictions using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
An RNN regressor is created in this model where the model predicts the new stock price using the following information:
       
        i. Opening Price
        ii. Lowest Price of that day
        iii. Highest Price of that day
